# Restaurant Info Retriever

A general purpose project for myself to fetch info about restaurants and "do stuff" with it.

## Setup

This project is set up using virtualenvs. I'm using Python 3.8.3 since that's what I happen to have
installed, though others likely work as well.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source activate venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
